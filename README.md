# RCCAR_STM32F103C
Using the Ardumotive Bluetooth remote controlled car with STM32F103 Microcontroller.

This code is a conversion of the Ardumotive Arduino code to work with the STM32F103C or "Blue Pill." 
Using the libraries by "https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32," it is easy to program.

Another library that is easily installed by adding the link in your library preferences tab. 
"http://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json", then install the "STM32F1xx" in boards manager.

From there you can look up any number of videos on how to program the "Blue Pill" using the Arduino IDE.
